        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <p>Swift is an open source language (as of version 2.2) and anybody can contribute to its growth at the official 
           Swift <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift" target="_blank">Github Page</a>. If you are interested in contributing to Swift's growth,
           the official Swift <a href="https://swift.org/contributing" target="_blank">website</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Developing with Swift</h3>
        <p>Swift is primarily developed using Xcode on OS X. However, it is possible to develop swift code on Linux as well. There is a REPL,
           Debugger, and variety of libraries available for use on Linux once everything is installed as outlined 
           <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Target Platforms</h3>
        <p>The primary platforms that support Swift code are OS X, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. 
           Apple has also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on their website 
           that new platforms will eventually be supported as new versions of Swift are released. Swift is a systems programming language and can
           be used to write systems level code, as well as applications for both the desktop and mobile environments. The current version of Swift
           (2.2) is not available to use directly for web programming, howevever there are a lot of developers working on support for this. IBM
           has created <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/swift/products/kitura/" target="_blank">Kitura</a> as a modular, package based web framework.
           The goal of Kitura is merge the development of front-end and back-end code into one language, which ultimately simplifies the process
           of creating applications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Compatibility</h3>
        <p>Swift has seamless integratation with Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, as well as the Objective-C runtime (on OS X), and the AppKit and UIKit
           frameworks (through the Objective-C runtime).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Third-Party Extensions</h3>
        <p>Many other developers besides Apple are using Swift and broadening the reachability of Swift code. For instance, RemObjects Software
           created a Swift compiler for .NET CLR, Java, and Android called Silver, and have made it compatible with Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE.
           IBM has also brough Swift programming to the cloud with their excellent 
           <a href="https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net/#/repl" target="_blank">Swift Sandbox</a>. The sandbox lets you write, run, and save native
           Swift code right inside of your web browser.

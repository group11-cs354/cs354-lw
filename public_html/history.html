        <h3>Early Development</h3>
        
        <p>Swift started out as a one man effort, but quickly grew into a multi-team collaboration. The language became an important aspect
            of the Developer Tools team at Apple. <a href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Resume.html" target="_blank">Chris Lattner</a> is responsible 
            for the early work on Swift. He has an impressive background;
            Chris is the original author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure and has his Ph.D. in Computer Science. 
            He is also an integral member at Apple and has taken on various roles throughout his continued time at the company.

        <blockquote cite="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/">Chris Lattner, currently the Director of the Developer Tools department at Apple, 
            started work on Swift in July of 2010.
            <br />During the next year, he worked on the basic language structure. Three years later, in July 2013, Swift became
            a priority focus for the Apple Developer Tools group. The language quickly became a large-effort collaboration,
            with involvement from various expert teams, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Language Team</li>
                <li>Documentation Team</li>
                <li>Compiler optimization Team</li>
                <li>Feedback and Testing Team</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Public Unveil</h3>
        <p>On June 2nd, 2014 at Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC), 
           Swift was shown off to the world. Apple showed off a ton of exciting <a href="features.html">features</a>
           and held multiple developer sessions to let developers at the show get a first glimpse of what to expect from the language. Apple also
           touted the Swift Playground, where you can edit code and see the results in realtime. They also announced that all of Swift's features
           would be built right into Xcode, the native IDE on OS X. Furthermore, they 
           <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-launches-swift-a-new-programming-language-for-writing-ios-and-os-x-apps/">highlighted</a> 
           the readability and usability of the language for beginner or advanced programmers alike.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Open-Sourced</h3>
        <p>On June 8th, 2015, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=29" target="_blank">announced</a> Swift 2.0 at their WWDC. 
            The main additions announced were:
             <ul>
                 <li>Increased Performance</li>
                 <li>New API for Error Handling</li>
                 <li>First-Class Support for Availability Checking (ability to see if the API you're using is too new for target OS)</li>
                 <li>Protocol Extensions (global functions are replaced with methods to common types)</li>
                 <li>Syntax Improvements</li>
             </ul>
             In addition to these changes, Apple announced that Swift was going open source. The initial rollout included support for OS X and iOS.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Today: Swift 2.2</h3>
        <p>Swift 2.2 was released on March 21st, 2016. This was the first update to the language since it went open source. The update included
           contributions from 212 non-Apple developers that spanned across the language. The 
           <a href="https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-released/" target="_blank">notable features</a> from this update include:
           <ul>
               <li>Bug Fixes</li>
               <li>Diagnostic Enhancements</li>
               <li>Faster-running Code</li>
               <li>Tuple Comparison Operators</li>
               <li>Support for Swift on Linux (REPL and LLDB)</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>Apple is expected to show off Swift 3 at their WWDC this year (2016) and discuss new changes to the language, as well as
            even greater support for Linux, including the Swift Core Libraries.

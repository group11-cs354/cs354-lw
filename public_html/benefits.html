        <h3>Standard Language for Multiple Platforms</h3>
        <p>Swift was built to be a robust language capable of working across all of Apple's platforms and integrating seamlessly
            with their frameworks. Since Swift is open-source, it is free to download for everyone and has a strong community
            pushing the language's progression forward. Furthermore, Apple is backing the language and there are no signs
            of slowing down for new features or improvements to the language. On top of this, Apple makes their IDE (Xcode)
            available to download for free, so anybody can experiment with the language and offer (or implement!) suggestions/improvements.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning Swift</h3>
        <p>Because of its intuitive, clear coding style, Swift is easy to pick up and learn for beginners and advanced programmers
            alike. Swift was influenced by a lot of popular languages. Because of this, Swift has many of the popular features
            you'd expect from these languages.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Influencers of Swift</h3>
